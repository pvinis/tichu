rules
==

The players play in two teams each of two players. Each player sits opposite his partner and they work together in acquiring points.
Preparation

The winner of the previous round shuffles and cuts the deck.

Instead of dealing out the cards, each player in turn takes a card from the top of the deck until the pile is exhausted and each player has 14 cards in his hand. Editor's note: We just deal the cards normally by first dealing 8 cards to each player and later giving each player 6 more (the reason for the two phases of dealing is below).

Now give one of your cards to each of the other three players. In effect, then, you will pass on 3 cards of your choice and receive 3 unknown ones in return.
The Game

The game is started by the player who has the Mah Jong card. He may lay down any one of the following combinations:

Example

    A single card - 4
    A pair (two cards of the same value) - 8,8
    A run of pairs of adjoining values - 9,9,10,10,J,J
    A triple (three cards of the same value) - 2,2,2
    A full house (triple and pair) - 5,5,5,9,9
    A row (also known as a straight or run) of at least five cards (the Ace can be used in a run but only as a high card such as 10JQKA - A2345 is not a legal play) - 4,5,6,7,8

The next player (to the right of the previous player) now has the following options:

Passing or Playing a similar combination but of a higher value

So, a single card can only be beaten by the playing of a single card (and this must be of a higher value); a run of 2 pairs by a run of 2 higher pairs, a row of 6 cards only by a higher row of 6 cards (3,4,5,6,7,8 is beaten by, at a minimum a row of 4,5,6,7,8,9), a full house by a higher full house (in a full house, only the value of the triple is taken into consideration). The only exception to this rule is the "Bomb" - see later.

Play then proceeds to the next player on the right. If all four players pass consecutively, the player who laid the last (highest) card combination, takes the trick and starts play again - if he has no more cards in his hand, he retires from the game and play proceeds to his neighbour on the right (if he also has no cards, then play goes to the next person on the right etc.). It is legal for players to pass and then come back in again as long as some other player played in between.
The Special Cards
The "Mah Jong" Card

Whoever has this card in his hand makes the first lead (but in doing so does not actually have to play the Mah Jong card although me may do so if he wishes).

The Mah Jong card has a value of 1 and so is the lowest card in the game. It can be used to form a row eg. 1,2,3,4,5

Whoever plays the Mah Jong (alone or as part of a row) card must call for a card - that is he must name a specific card value (eg an "8" or an "A", but not a special card). The next player who has a card of the chosen value and can play it (in accordance with the rules of the game) must then play it (under certain circumstances it can also be used as a "Bomb".)

If a player does not have the card value asked for, or cannot play it, then he can play any suitable combination or pass.

This condition, imposed by the playing of the Mah Jong card, remains in force on all players for all plays until somebody carries it out. Once the card is played by any playr, the condition is no longer in effect on anybody.
The Dog

The "Dog" has no trick value. It can only be played in your own turn when you have the lead and is played as a single card. It immediately gives the "lead" to your partner. If your partner has already retired from the game, then the lead passes to the player on his right.
The Phoenix

The Phoenix is a very powerful card. It has a value of -25 points in the final point scoring.

It can be used as a joker in any card combination (but it cannot be used to create a Bomb - see later). However, in its role as a joker it can not be used as any of the other special cards (it can only be a 2-Ace).

It can be played as a single card. It then has a value of a half point above the last card played (eg if the Phoenix is played after an "8", then the value of the Phoenix is 8.5 and can only be beaten by a single card of value "9" or higher. The Phoenix will beat an "A" but not the Dragon. If the Phoenix is played first it has a value of 1.5
The Dragon

The Dragon is the highest single card and counts 25 points.

It can only be played as a single card and it beats even an "A" (Ace) or an "A and a half" (A Phoenix played on an "A").

It can only be beaten by a "Bomb".

If the Dragon wins the trick, the player playing it must give the entire trick away (including its own 25 points) to a player of the opposing team (he chooses which one). Despite this, the player who won the trick also wins the next lead.
A Bomb

Bombs are:

    a row of at least 5 cards following on in sequence from each other, and all of the same suit (also known as a "straight flush")

    or - four cards of the same value (also known as a "four of a kind").

A Bomb beats all other cards, be it a single card or a card combination. A higher Bomb beats a lower one so four 8's beats four 7's.

A "row" Bomb beats a "4" Bomb and is in turn beaten by a higher or longer row Bomb. For example the following list of Bombs is ordered from lowest to highest Bomb:

    4444
    5555
    45678 (all Green)
    56789 (all Blue)
    234567 (all Blue)

Bombs can be brought into play at any time - even when it is not your turn. However, you must give a player a chance to lead a card and Bombs can not be played on just the Dog card.
Points Reckoning Up
The game is played until three of the four players have played all of their cards. The final play of the third player to go out automatically wins and he collects this final trick (unless of course he played the Dragon).

The one player remaining, who still has cards in his hand, gives:

    any remaining cards in his hand to the opposing team.
    all the tricks he has won to the winner of the round (the player who was the first to play all his cards).

Now count up the card points:

    The "kings" and "10's" are worth 10 points each
    The "5's" are worth 5 points each
    The Dragon is worth 25 points
    The Phoenix costs you 25 points

Exception: However, if both players of one team have a double victory (one being the winner of the round and the other coming second), then that team scores 200 points and the other team 0. In this case, card points are not counted. In fact, once this occurs there is no reason for the remaining players to even finish playing the hand.
Calling Tichu

Before playing his first card, each player has the right to declare a small "Tichu" If he then wins the round (finishes first), his team receives an extra 100 points - otherwise the team loses 100 points.

But remember:

    The 100 Tichu points are given / taken away regardless of the ordinary or double victory points scored - they do not influence them in any way.

You can call a Tichu any time before playing your first card. You can therefore choose to pass for several full tricks and still call a Tichu later.

You can also call a Tichu before passing on cards at the beginning of the round - this serves to tell your partner to pass on to you his best card.

You can neither make any arrangements with your partner nor does it help you if your partner wins.

You can also call a "large Tichu" before you have taken your ninth card (in the "deal" section at the very beginning of the round). This has a value of 200 extra points.

It is entirely legal for more than one player (even on the same team) to call either type of Tichu. Obviously, however, only one of them can be right.
Winning the Game

When one team reaches 1000 points they are the winners. If both teams reach 1000 points in the same round, then the winning team is the one with the most points.
Notes and Rule Details (by Aaron)

1) None of the four special cards can be used in any type of Bomb.

2) In regard to the requirements of the Mah Jong card:

    It is legal to name a card of which you know that all 4 have already been played - doing so will put no burden on any player.
    Assume a "7" has been named as the player plays a row of 12345. If you have cards 5689 and the Phoenix (joker), you do NOT have to play on the trick. However, if you have 5678 and the Phoenix, you DO have to play on the trick by making the Phoenix a 4 or a 9, allowing you to play your "natural" 7. You would also have to play if you had 7777.
    Since bombs can be played out of order, you can do some odd things. For example, let us say you have 2222 456789 and the player before you plays the Mah Jong alone and calls for a 7. Basically you must either play a single 7 (which would be bad as it would leave you with 5 fairly low single cards) or you can instead play a bomb of 2222. If this bomb wins the trick, you must then play a 7 but it is legal to play the 7 then as part of a combination so you would be able to play the row of 456789.

3) It is legal to play a Bomb on top of any play except the Dog. If played on the Dragon, the trick does not have to be given away.

4) The order of play given above is counterclockwise - each player is followed by the player on his right. Feel free to play it in the more common American clockwise fashion where each player is followed by the player on his left.
Hints

Try to get rid of your bad cards (low single cards and pairs) as quickly as possible and be economical with your "A's", "Dragons" and "Bombs".

Whoever, after a good power play, remains sitting on a single "4" has not yet grasped the garlic. That is, don't leave yourself with low cards and no way to ever get the lead.

If your partner is playing a Tichu, help him unreservedly. When you are the Mah Jong player, do not demand any card that could deprive him of a "Bomb" nor of a trick. Naming the card you passed to the player who plays after you is one way to make sure not to hurt your partner.

If an opponent declares a 'Tichu' then play against him, so that he finds it hard to get rid of his cards.
